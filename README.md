# What is Jenkins?

* it is an automation server used to build and deliver software projects .
# What is CI /CD ?
* Continuous Integration ( CI ) is the practice , in softare engineering , of merging all developer working copies to shared machine several times a day.
* Contineous Delivery is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.

In practice: verify and pulish work by triggering automated builds and tests.

All developers should push their changes to a version control, which should then be built and testing - which cn be done by jenkins.
