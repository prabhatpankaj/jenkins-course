# Starting, stopping, and restarting Jenkins on Ubuntu
Jenkins by default starts running when installed. Here are the commands to start, stop, restart, and check the status of the Jenkins service:

* To start Jenkins, use the following command:
 ```shell
 sudo systemctl start jenkins
 ```
* Similarly, to stop Jenkins, use the following command:
  ```shell
  sudo systemctl stop jenkins
  ```
* To restart Jenkins, use the following command:
```shell
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```
* To check the status of the Jenkins service, use the following systemctl command:
```shell
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```
You should see the following output:
```shell
